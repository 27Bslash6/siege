# Siege in Docker

Yet another docker siege implementation.

Created because I couldn't find a current version docker siege on the hub.

Yep, it's huge: 255MB for siege.  Could probably use a multi-build optimisation or two.

```
$ docker run --rm siege siege --version
New configuration template added to /root/.siege
Run siege -C to view the current settings in that file
SIEGE 4.0.4
